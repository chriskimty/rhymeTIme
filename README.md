# About
<p><a href="https://itsrhymetime.netlify.app/"> RhymeTime</a> is a single-page React application that generates rhymes per user-generated search word.</p>

<p>This project was completed in November 2022 with <a href="https://junocollege.com">Juno College's</a> Web Development Bootcamp âœ¨ Cohort 44 âœ¨, as part of a solo React project, to showcase my understanding of:</p>
* Core React concepts (state, props, components, app architecture)
* Working with third-party API/data sources
* Error handling
* UI design
* Functional programming
* Environmental variables
<p>
RhymeTime is graciously powered by the <a href="https://www.wordsapi.com/">WordsAPI</a>, and additional features are soon to be added including: </p>
* A synonym generator 
* An antonym generator
